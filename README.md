# Cricket Score Predictor 🏏

This project predicts the final cricket score of a team based on various match conditions using a neural network model. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and an interactive UI is provided using `ipywidgets`.

---

## Features 🚀
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical data using label encoding and normalizes features using Min-Max scaling.
- **Neural Network**: A regression model with multiple dense layers optimized using the Huber loss function.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly dropdown menus to input match conditions and predict scores in real-time.
- **Customizable**: Built with modular components, making it easy to extend and enhance.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Label encoding, scaling, and train-test splitting.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: Neural network architecture and training.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Ipywidgets**: Interactive user interface.

## Usage 💻

### Training the Model
Run the script to preprocess the data, train the model, and save the results:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Interactive Prediction
Run the notebook to access the interactive UI:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Load `cricket_score_predictor.ipynb`.
3. Execute all cells to train the model and launch the interactive UI.
4. Use the dropdown menus to select match conditions and click "Predict Score."
